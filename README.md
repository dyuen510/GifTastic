# GifTastic

A gif based app that retrieves gifs from giphy.com. 
On click of the button value, 5 specific gifs related to the value will be displayed for the user.
Once the gifs is clicked, it would change the state of that specific gif and put it into motion.
Clicking it again would change the state again and make it motionless.
